# 🧠 AI Agent for Loan Data Insights using OpenAI API

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered data assistant that answers natural language questions about a structured loan dataset. It uses **OpenAI's GPT-4o model** and **pandas** to simulate an intelligent agent that understands data context and generates human-like answers.
